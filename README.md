Car Price Prediction:

This repository contains the code and data for predicting car prices using machine learning models. The project is based on the Kaggle Playground Series Season 4, Episode 9 dataset.

Project Structure:

train.csv: Training dataset containing features and target prices.
test.csv: Testing dataset used for making predictions.
sample_submission.csv: Sample submission file format.
Regression_UsedCars.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Predicted Prices Submission: Folder containing the predicted prices in the submission format.

Requirements:

To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage:

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/zubcr7/CarPrice_Kaggle_playground-series-s4e9.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd CarPrice_Kaggle_playground-series-s4e9

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook Regression_UsedCars.ipynb

4. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and generate predictions.

Model Description

The project uses the following regression models to predict car prices:

Decision Tree Regressor

XgBoost

The following steps are performed:

Data Exploration and Visualization
Data Preprocessing
Model Training and Evaluation
Submission File Generation

Libraries and Modules Used

The Jupyter Notebook uses the following libraries and modules:

1. matplotlib.pyplot – For data visualization and plotting.
2. numpy – For numerical operations and array manipulations.
3. pandas – For data manipulation and analysis.
4. re – For regular expression operations.
5. seaborn – For statistical data visualization.
6. sklearn.decomposition – For dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA).
7. sklearn.ensemble – For ensemble learning models like Random Forest.
8. sklearn.linear_model – For linear models like Linear Regression.
9. sklearn.metrics – For evaluating model performance.
10. sklearn.model_selection – For splitting data and model validation.
11. sklearn.preprocessing – For data preprocessing like scaling and encoding.
12. sklearn.tree – For decision tree models.
13. warnings – For managing warning messages.
14. xgboost – For gradient boosting algorithms.

Results:

The predictions are saved in the Predicted Prices Submission folder. You can use these files for submission on the Kaggle competition.
